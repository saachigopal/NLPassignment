        label: a string.  A name the user gives to the Sample.

        text: a list of the words from some original document, in the order they
            appeared in that document, all converted into lowercase. We assume
            that punctuation has been removed and no words contain whitespace.

        length: a non-negative int.  The length of text.

        unigram_counts: a dictionary.  Keys are words that appear in text (no
            repeats).  The value for a given word w is the number of times
            w occurs in text.

        bigram_dict: a dictionary whose keys are words that appear in text (no
            repeats).  The value for a given key w is a list of each of the words
            that immediately follow w in text, repeats included.

        trigram_dict: a dictionary whose keys are two-word sequences that occur
            in text, separated by a space when stored as a key.
            The value for a given key (word pair) "w x" is a list of each word
            that immediately follows "w x" in text.


        Example: if text were ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal"],
        then
            unigram_counts should contain key-value pairs "a":3, "man":1, etc.
            bigram_dict should contain key-value pairs "a":["man", "plan", "canal"],
                "man":["a"], etc.
            trigram_dict should contain key-value pairs "a man":["a"],
                "man a":["plan"], etc.
